T1/T3 E-Learning
1.  Welcome to Cisco TelePresence E-Learning. 
2.  Upon completion of this module, you will have basic understanding of the following TelePresence Systems: T3 Immersive, T1 Immersive, T1 Room System, Profile 65”, and Profile 65” Dual.  The following topics will be covered for each system: Product overview, Identifying main, components, Physical location of the components, Logical connection of the components.
3.  The TelePresence system creates a live, face-to-face meeting experience over the network. It feels like the meeting is in the same room with remote participants. It combines video, audio, and data sharing for collaboration through hardware and software.  The TelePresence covered in this course consists of the following systems: T3 Immersive, T1 Immersive, T1 Room System, Profile 65”, and Profile 65” Dual.  The differences between the immersive and non-immersive systems are size, room treatment and inclusion of an integrated table.  Both the T3 immersive and T1 immersive have special wall treatment such as blue glass and walnut walls.  An immersive room also has custom lighting and an integrated table with a touch panel display for control, customization and navigation.  The T3 immersive system has 3 65” side by side and a single large table to accommodate up to 9 participants.  Participants are immersed in the call because of the HD life size video and high quality audio coming from all the remote end points.   All the TelePresence endpoints are allowed to join multipoint meetings. For example, a T3 Immersive, T1 Room System and a Profile 65” can all be in the same meeting.
