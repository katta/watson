Introduction
Cisco TelePresence Management Suite Installation and Getting Started Guide Page 6 of 70
Introduction
The Cisco TelePresence Management Suite (Cisco TMS) is a portal for managing and monitoring your
video conferencing system from a single structured overview. Cisco TMS provides centralized control
for on-site and remote video systems, and a deployment and scheduling system for your entire video
network.
Cisco TMS can be downloaded from Cisco.com.
Cisco TMS is a powerful tool for maintaining, operating, and increasing the value of your conferencing
network. Cisco TMS adds intelligence, diagnostics, and functionality that enhance your video network
components and the return on your investment.
Cisco TMS automates system configuration for a basic H.323 network, operating ‘right out of the box’.
You can tune Cisco TMS default behavior to suit your organization needs, set up user permissions,
and configure your network model so that all of Cisco TMS call handling functionalities are available.
This document provides information for fresh installs, upgrading an existing version, or configuring the
Cisco TMS version that comes preinstalled on a Cisco TelePresence Management Server. There is
also a guide for uninstalling Cisco TMS.
Along with installation/upgrade processes, you will find guidelines on software and hardware
requirements, integrating Cisco TMS with other applications, and version specific upgrade information.
Further information on Cisco TMS functionality is available online. Cisco also maintains a Cisco TMS
knowledgebase.
Note: For the Cisco TMS user guide, see the online help available via the question mark icon (?) on
the Cisco TMS client.
A list of relevant documents referred to in this guide can be found in the References and related
documents section.
Cisco TMS requirements
Cisco TelePresence Management Suite Installation and Getting Started Guide Page 7 of 70
Cisco TMS requirements
This section details software and hardware requirements. Review and verify these requirements
before installing, upgrading or configuring your preinstalled Cisco TelePresence Management Servers.
Operating system
Previous versions of Cisco TMS required a 32bit Windows operating system.
Note: As of version 13 Cisco TMS functions with 64bit Windows 2008 operating systems. See below
for further details.
The operating system must be English, Japanese or Chinese.
Web server
Hardware Specifications
Pentium compatible processor: 2GHz or higher
Memory: 1GB RAM or more (2GB or more recommended)
For Provisioning, 2GB or more is recommended. The installer will warn you
during installation if less than 2GB is detected.
Disk Space: 4GB for installation and application footprint
(Additional space is required if you are installing the SQL Server
locallyD14389_TANDBERG_ Management_Suite_
Installation_and_Getting_Started_Guide(ek_edit).docx -
_SQL_Database_Server)
Version compatibility
The following Windows versions are compatible with Cisco TMS:
 Windows 2003 Server Standard/Enterprise/DataCenter Editions w/SP1 or greater (latest Service
Pack recommended)
 Windows 2003 R2 Standard/Enterprise/DataCenter Editions w/SP1 or greater (latest Service
Pack recommended)
 Windows 2008 R1 or R2 Standard 32bit and 64bit Editions (latest Service Pack recommended)
Windows Server 2000 is no longer supported
Microsoft Windows Server 2000 (any version) is no longer supported. Customers running Cisco TMS
on a Windows Server 2000 OS must upgrade their server to Windows Server 2003. See Upgrading
Windows 2000 to Windows 2003.
Microsoft .NET Framework 4.x now required
Cisco TMS 13.x requires Microsoft .NET Framework version 4.x. The Cisco TMS installer prompts you
to install .NET 4.x if it is not detected. (Previously, Cisco TMS 12.x required Microsoft .NET
Framework version 3.5).
IIS 7 is required
If you are using Windows 2008 Standard 32bit or 64bit Editions, the installer will install IIS 7 if it is not
already present.
Cisco TMS requirements
Cisco TelePresence Management Suite Installation and Getting Started Guide Page 8 of 70
Windows 2008 default firewall rules
Windows Server 2008 includes a new Windows Firewall feature that controls both inbound and
outbound ports. This feature is enabled by default. If Windows Firewall is enabled, the ports required
for Cisco TMS must be opened. For details see Ports required by Cisco TMS.
SQL database server
SQL Server version compatibility
Note: Microsoft SQL Server 2000 Desktop Engine (MSDE 2000) and Microsoft SQL 2000 are no
longer supported. Assistance on upgrading to SQL 2005 Server can be found in the Cisco TMS
Database Knowledge Base Tips.
Cisco TMS supports:
 Microsoft SQL Server 2005 Database Server with Mixed Authentication Mode enabled. All 32bit
versions of Microsoft SQL Server 2005, including the Express Edition (see caveat below)
 Microsoft SQL Server 2008 both 32bit and 64bit
Note: Large installations with databases more than 4GB must use a full edition of SQL Server 2005,
because of the 4GB database limitation in Express Edition.
If there is not an SQL DB present on the server, MS SQL Server 2008 Express 32 bit will be installed.
Cisco TMS operational
The following are required by Cisco TMS to function properly:
 Domain Membership Preferred – Each user logging into Cisco TMS needs a Windows User
Login to authenticate: either a local account on the Cisco TMS Windows Server or a Domain
account that the server trusts through Active Directory. By making the server a member of the
domain, trusted domain users will automatically be able to use their Windows credentials to log
into Cisco TMS. You can still limit user permissions using Cisco TMS. Active Directory
membership is the recommended deployment for most installations because it avoids creating
local Windows accounts for each user.
 ASP.NET and ASP Enabled – These IIS components must be enabled. If you are using
Windows 2008, see Installing IIS 7 for Windows 2008.
 Cisco TMS Web site Accessible by IP and Hostname - Because not all devices support DNS
hostnames or Port Numbers, Cisco TMS must be accessible by an IP Address on port 80. Some
functionality requires Cisco TMS to be reachable by hostname; therefore, Cisco TMS is also
accessible by a fully qualified hostname.
 Mail Server Access - Cisco TMS requires access to an SMTP (Mail) server to send emails. Cisco
TMS does not require its own SMTP server and can be configured to use existing mail servers. If
you are unsure which server to use, contact your IT administrator. (Cisco TMS supports SMTP
Auth login for authentication if required.)
 Network Access to Managed Devices – Cisco TMS needs specific protocols and access to
manage devices. Any network firewalls or NAT routers must allow traffic to flow to and from Cisco
TMS. The specific protocols and directions in use will vary depending on devices being managed:
see the Cisco TMS Product Support document (available on the Cisco TMS installation media) for
specific information about firewall requirements for each type of supported device.
 DNS records and Provisioning Directory functionality (Cisco TMS Agent) – In installations
using the Cisco TMS Provisioning Directory functionality for Cisco TelePresence Movi and E20
deployments, the local hostname of the Cisco TMS server must match the DNS A record for the
Cisco TMS Agent to operate correctly.
Cisco TMS requirements
Cisco TelePresence Management Suite Installation and Getting Started Guide Page 9 of 70
 TCP Port 25 – Many anti-virus programs block applications from sending mail directly using the
SMTP Port (TCP Port 25). Verify your anti-virus program is configured to allow
this.http://www.tandberg.com/support/video-conferencingdocumentation.

Cisco TMS client
Cisco TMS is accessed by both administrators and users via a web browser. Disable all pop-up
blocking functions for the Cisco TMS web site.
Minimum specifications
 Microsoft Internet Explorer 6.0 or later
 Mozilla Firefox 2.0 or later
 Java Virtual Machine Runtime Engine (JRE) 1.5.0 or later
 A Windows username and password to the Cisco TMS Server (either a local machine account, or
a domain account, if the server is joined to a domain)
Recommended specifications
 Microsoft Internet Explorer 7.0 or 8.0
 Mozilla Firefox 4.0 or 5.0
 Java Virtual Machine Runtime Engine (JRE) 1.5.0 or later
A Java Virtual Machine Runtime Engine (JRE) is required to use the Cisco TMS monitoring function. If
browser does not automatically prompt to download and install the missing browser plug-in, you can
install it manually from the JRE installation file found on the Cisco TMS installation media or at
http://www.java.com.
Installation and upgrade guidelines
Cisco TelePresence Management Suite Installation and Getting Started Guide Page 10 of 70
Installation and upgrade guidelines
Cisco TelePresence recommend reviewing these guidelines before installation or upgrading, and
cover a number of issues that may relate to your Cisco TMS application.
Moving the Cisco TMS database
To move the Cisco TMS database to a new server, it is recommended the database and/or database
server be moved prior to running the Cisco TMS v12 installer. Use the standard Microsoft SQL tools
(the Cisco TMS database is named ‘TMSng’), and then select ‘Custom’ during the Cisco TMS v12
installation. You can then specify the database location.
Dedicated vs. shared server
Cisco TMS is resource intensive with specific server requirements and installation is not
recommended on a server hosting other applications or web sites. CPU time and memory usage will
vary between installations depending on the activity level and size of the video network being
managed.
Note: Cisco TelePresence will not support installations on shared servers. Cisco TelePresence
strongly recommends installing Cisco TMS on a dedicated server.
Cisco TMS can be installed on a Virtual Server, but the Cisco TMS virtual machine (child partition)
must be provided with sufficient processor resources, memory, and disk resources. The minimum
requirements assume Cisco TMS has full access to resources. Cisco TMS runs on VMWare ESX and
Virtual Server products and on Microsoft Virtual Server 2007.
Cisco TMS integration compatibility matrix
Note: The most recent software versions may be required for all features and fixes to be available.

Device support
Cisco TMS supports video conferencing systems from both Cisco TelePresence and other major
vendors, and Cisco TelePresence constantly strives for the best possible feature parity. However, due
to differences in capabilities and APIs, some features of Cisco TMS and device support are dependent
on the individual products and their software versions. Some system types require additional
configuration.
Cisco TelePresence maintains Cisco TMS Product Support Documentation, including information on:
 version compatibility information
 network requirements (firewall information)
 device configuration settings
Installation and upgrade guidelines
Cisco TelePresence Management Suite Installation and Getting Started Guide Page 11 of 70
 feature support
 device notes
This information is available on the Cisco TMS installation media and the Cisco TelePresence support
web pages. Be sure to use the revision of the document that applies to your Cisco TMS version.
SQL database server guidelines
Cisco TMS stores all its customer data in its SQL database named ‘TMSng’. This self-contained
storage allows for convenient backup and recovery of customer information.
Disk space
Smaller deployments (<100 systems) can, on average, expect database sizes on the order of 50MB –
2GB. Medium deployments (100-500 systems) can expect databases on the order of 1GB-6GB, and
very large or very heavy networks can expect databases of approximately 6GB-10GB.
Microsoft SQL Server automatically sets and manages database size. Cisco TMS also provides a
method to manage growth in Administrative Tools > TMS Server Maintenance, where you can set
data retention limits.
Local vs. Remote server
The SQL database server and Cisco TMS can be both be hosted on the same machine, or on
separate machines. During installation, you can choose between using an existing SQL Server or
installing MS SQL Server 2008 Express 32 bit locally on the Cisco TMS server.
Running SQL on a separate server is strongly recommended for large (100+ system) or high-usage
video networks because there are performance benefits due to the high memory and disk I/O load
associated with running an SQL Server. A separate server solution improves Cisco TMS performance
by freeing up memory and disk resources.
If your TMSng database is on an external Microsoft SQL Server 2005, set the Microsoft SQL Server
compatibility level 90.
Database permissions
The SQL database server must have Mixed Mode Authentication enabled; Windows Authentication is
not supported by the Cisco TMS installer. For new installations, the installer creates a database
named ‘TMSng’ using the SQL Server defaults. Upgrades will reuse an existing Cisco TMS database.
When installing or upgrading Cisco TMS and using an existing SQL Server, the Cisco TMS installer
prompts for a SQL user and password. The default is to enter the server sa (system administrator)
username and password. If the sa account is not available, use one of the following:
 Automatic setup, but with security limited role. Ask your SQL server administrator to create a
SQL user and login that has the ‘dbcreator’ and ‘securityadmin’ server roles. This account will be
the service account for Cisco TMS. When prompted for SQL Server credentials during installation,
enter the username and password for that account. Cisco TMS will create the ‘TMSng’ database
automatically using the server defaults and assign itself as the owner. Cisco TMS will continue to
use the supplied account to access the database after installation.
 Manual database creation, max security limited role. Ask your SQL server administrator to
create:
· A database named 'TMSng' with the appropriate options. The database collation must be
SQL_Latin1_General_Cp1_CI_AS or SQL_Latin1_General_Cp1_CS_AS.
· An SQL user and login to use for the Cisco TMS Service account and grant the user the
‘dbowner’ role for the ‘TMSng’ database.
When you are prompted for the SQL Server credentials during installation, enter the username and
password for that account. The Cisco TMS installer will populate the ‘TMSng’ database as required,
and will continue to use this account to access the database after installation.
Installation and upgrade guidelines
Cisco TelePresence Management Suite Installation and Getting Started Guide Page 12 of 70
Note: For Cisco TMS to function properly the SQL user supplied for Cisco TMS to use must always
have ‘dbowner’ permission on the ‘TMSng’ database, even after installation.
Performing SQL database backups
Follow best practices and take regular backups of the Cisco TMS SQL database named ‘TMSng’.
Backups can be performed on the server via a local console or Windows Remote Desktop. Additional
help on performing SQL backups is available in the Cisco TMS Database Knowledge Base Tips
document available on the Cisco TMS installation media. It is recommended that backups are stored
at a separate location for maximum protection.
Note: The Cisco TelePresence Management Server is delivered with remote SQL access disabled.
If you enable remote access to the SQL Server for backup purposes, be sure to change the SQL sa
password from the default password. If you change the SQL password, update TMS Database
Connection properties using the TMS Tools application installed in the TANDBERG Program Group on
the Cisco TelePresence Management Server.
Note: A Cisco TMS Agent database backup can be performed and scheduled by going to the TMS
Agent Settings page found under Administrative Tools > Configuration > TMS Agent Settings.
Upgrading Windows 2000 to Windows 2003
If you are upgrading from Windows 2000 to Windows 2003, Microsoft recommends performing a clean
installation.
Cisco TelePresence recommends backing up the Cisco TMS database, along with any customized
customer files, before upgrading Windows. After the Windows upgrade, reinstall your original Cisco
TMS version and restore the Cisco TMS database backup. Then upgrade to Cisco TMS v12 or newer.
Additional assistance on backing up and restoring Cisco TMS can be found in the Cisco TMS
Database Knowledge Base.
Restricting IIS 7 modules (optional)
IIS 7 has a modular system that allows administrators to install and enable components to customize
server security. The following modules are required for Cisco TMS. Modules may be controlled at
either site or server level (some are server level only) – the following steps assume that you are
making changes at the server level.
To modify which modules are enabled in IIS 7:
1. Go to Start Menu > Administrative Tools > Internet Information Services (IIS) Manager and
open the Internet Information Services (IIS) Manager.
2. From the tree in the left panel, click on your server name.
3. In the center panel, under IIS, double-click Modules.
The list of installed Managed and Native Modules is displayed. Modules that are not needed can
be removed by clicking on them, and then clicking Remove from the Action Panel on the right.
The following modules are required for Cisco TMS and must not be removed:
· AnonymousAuthenticationModule
· BasicaAuthenticationModule
· DefaultDocumentModule
· DigestAuthenticationModule
· HttpCacheModule
· HttpLoggingModule(recommended)
· HttprRedirectionModule
· IsapiFilterModule
· ProtocolSupportModule
· RequestFilteringModule
· Session
· StaticCompressionModule
· StaticFileModule
· WindowsAuthentication
· WindowsAuthenticationModule
Installation and upgrade guidelines
Cisco TelePresence Management Suite Installation and Getting Started Guide Page 13 of 70
Ports required by Cisco TMS
The default Windows Server 2008 firewall rules interfere with Cisco TMS communications. Cisco TMS
will not function properly until these Windows Firewall port settings are modified.
The following ports are used by Cisco TMS and must be enabled in the Windows Firewall. See the
Cisco TMS Product Support document for port specifics for each managed device type.
Administrators can disable Windows Firewall or open the ports required for Cisco TMS. See
http://technet.Microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc748991.aspx for Microsoft documentation on configuring
firewall rules.
Note: Cisco TMS cannot use multiple network cards on a server and will only bind to the first
available network interface. Cisco TMS can manage a public and private network so long as the
public network connection is further upstream from Cisco TMS, rather than being directly connected
to Cisco TMS (using multiple network interface cards).
Version specific upgrade notes
Cisco TelePresence Management Suite Installation and Getting Started Guide Page 14 of 70
Version specific upgrade notes
Review the notes for your current version of Cisco TMS before starting your upgrade.
Notes for upgrades from Cisco TMS 12.5/12.6
When installing and upgrading to Cisco TMS 13.0, Cisco TelePresence recommends upgrading the
Device Provisioning and Cisco VCS Database components on the Cisco VCS (Cisco TelePresence
Video Communication Server).
Also note the .NET requirements have changed. Cisco TMS version 12.x required .NET 3.5. Version
13.x requires .NET 4.0. The installer will warn you to install the correct version of :NET if it is not
detected.
The Cisco VCS must be running or upgraded to X5.1.1 before installing these components. To
upgrade the Cisco VCS go to Maintenance > Upgrade and select the relevant upgrade component
file. It is recommended replication between the Cisco TMS and any Cisco VCS be disabled when
upgrading these components.
With regard to DNS records and Provisioning Directory functionality (Cisco TMS Agent), DNS
reverse lookups (PTR records) that were required in Cisco TMS 12.5, are no longer required for Cisco
TMS 12.6/13.x. (Note that the same requirement applies to the Cisco VCS. See the Cisco VCS
Software Release Notes (X5) at Cisco TelePresence support documentation.)
Within Cisco TMS 12.6, under Administrative Tools > General Settings, note that Enable TMS
Agents is set to No by default. If enabled, Cisco TelePresence recommends going to Cisco TMS
Agent Diagnostics under Administrator Tools > TMS Agent Diagnostics to confirm that the Local
Cisco TMS Agent shows no errors and that all diagnostic tests are OK.
If any errors are found on the Local Cisco TMS Agent, then these errors need to be fixed before
proceeding with replication to any Cisco VCS. Refer to the Diagnostic section within Cisco TMS
Provisioning Deployment Guide for help troubleshooting errors found on the Local Cisco TMS Agent.
Warning: Upgrades will be blocked if the procedures found in this document are not followed
appropriately. The error message will state that Provisioning on all clusters must be disabled before
upgrading to 12.6.
Notes for all versions earlier than Cisco TMS 12.2
A onetime database clean-up is required when upgrading versions Cisco TMS 12.1 or earlier.
For a large installation this can take 30 to 60 minutes depending on the performance of the SQL
server, the type and number of calls scheduled in Cisco TMS, and the participant count. For most
installations however, this process only takes an additional minute or two.
During this clean-up process, you will see a ‘Upgrading from Cisco TMS 12.x to Cisco TMS 12.x’
notification. The progress bar may not move but the installation is still running. Please be patient! Do
not stop or attempt to stop the installation process during this step.
For more details about this update, see the Installation and Upgrades section of the Cisco TMS 12.6
part of the Cisco TMS v12 Release Notes.
Notes for upgrades from Cisco TMS 12.1 or 12.2
If you are upgrading Cisco TMS from either 12.1 or 12.2 and Cisco VCS to X5 software, you must
follow the upgrade procedures found in the Cisco VCS Deployment Guide - Cluster creation and
maintenance (X5) documentation available at Cisco TelePresence online support.
Note: Your upgrade process will be blocked and need to be restarted if the procedures found in this
document are not followed. The error message states that provisioning on all clusters needs to be
disabled.
Notes for upgrades from Cisco TMS 12.0
It is recommended you review the Provisioning Directory Deployment Guide if:

Notes for upgrades from Cisco TMS v11.x
If you are using a Cisco TelePresence Content Server (TCS) with Cisco TMS, all TCS must be running
version S2.0 or later. If you are upgrading from versions prior to S2, update all the server
configurations and update any future bookings (see the Supplement Notes for Manuals section of the
Cisco TMS v11.6 release in the Cisco TMS v11 Release Notes document available from the Cisco
TelePresence web site.
Starting with Cisco TMS v12.0, permissions underwent slight reorganization. It is recommended that
administrators who implement different user levels through permissions review their user group
permissions after upgrading to Cisco TMS v12, and adjust the permissions to their intended settings if
necessary.
Additional Notes for upgrades from versions 9.x and 10.x
Cisco TMS has gone through significant changes since these releases, and while the Cisco TMS
installer will import existing data, there are many new settings and existing settings that have changed.
Be sure to work through the Administrative Tools settings after installation to populate and update the
Cisco TMS installation. In particular, the permissions model has been overhauled and Group
Permissions and System Permissions must be reviewed and updated. Expect inconsistent behavior
between different systems until Cisco TMS has refreshed the configuration of each system – normally
this will happen automatically within 1-4 hours.
Additional notes for upgrade from versions prior to 9.x
Cisco TelePresence recommends a new installation rather than performing upgrade installations older
than Cisco TMS 9.0., although the Cisco TMS installer will still import existing data. Server
requirements have changed significantly, as well as the configuration and functionality throughout the
product making most direct upgrades significantly more complex than simply performing a new
installation on a new host server.

Cisco TelePresence Management Suite Installation and Getting Started Guide Page 17 of 70
Installing and upgrading Cisco TMS
The installation/upgrade process is made up of two parts. After completing an initial setup process, the
next process will depend on whether you choose a complete or custom installation.
Note: You may be prompted to reboot the server more than once during installation. The installer
automatically resumes after the server reboots.
Initial installation process
1. Close all open applications and disable virus-scanning software.
2. Extract the compressed Cisco TMS ZIP file to a folder and double-click Browse.bat in the root
directory. (It may be necessary to use a RAR decompressor application).
3. Click Cisco TelePresence Management Suite.
4. You will receive a language prompt. This language is only used during the installation and does
not affect Cisco TMS after installation. Select the Cisco TMS Installer language and click Next.
The installer checks for required software components. A warning message will be displayed if
any components are missing. Follow the prompts and install any missing components.
5. If an earlier version of Cisco TMS is currently installed, you are prompted to upgrade. To upgrade
- remove the old Cisco TMS and upgrade the existing Cisco TMS database, click Yes. To abort
the installation and leave the current installation untouched, click No.
6. You are prompted to choose from two processes: Complete or Custom. They are detailed in the
following two sections.
 Complete uses default settings. It can be used for upgrades of existing installations with both local
and remote SQL installations, and is the recommended choice for performing upgrades.
 Custom allows you to specify all the options such as the installation path and SQL server choices.
7. Select Complete or Custom and click Next.
Figure 1 Select Complete or Custom.
Installation and upgrade of Cisco TMS
Cisco TelePresence Management Suite Installation and Getting Started Guide Page 18 of 70
Complete installation process
Follow the process in this section if you chose ‘Complete’ for your installation type.
8. The installer searches for an existing SQL Server and Cisco TMS database.
a. If an existing database connection is found, the existing Cisco TMS database is used. When
prompted, enter the username and password to connect to the existing SQL server and click
Next. Go to step 2.
b. If no existing Cisco TMS database connection is found, the installer looks for a local SQL
server. If one is found, enter the username and password necessary to access the server and
allow the installer to create a new Cisco TMS database. Click Next and go to step 4.
c. If no existing Cisco TMS database connection or local SQL server is found, MS SQL Server
2008 Express 32 bit is installed and a new Cisco TMS database is created. When prompted,
enter a password for the sa account (administrator). Click Next and go to step 4.
Note: Be sure to note the sa password somewhere secure as it is required for future upgrades and
Cisco TMS maintenance.
Note: If the Cisco TMS server is in a domain or you have a local policy that has a strong password
policy, ensure that you use a strong password for the SQL installation.
Figure 2 SQL server user name and password.
9. You can re-use the existing database:
 To update the existing database to a current version and retain existing information, click Yes. Go
on to the next step.
 If you wish to install a new Cisco TMS database, then manually remove the existing database
from the SQL server, click No to abort the install.
10. Cisco TelePresence recommends that you take a backup of your existing database.
 To perform the backup, enter a path for the backup file and filename, or click Browse to navigate
to a folder. (The backup is done on the SQL Server itself, so these values are local to the SQL
Server.) Click Backup to start the backup. When the backup is complete (it may take several
minutes), click Next.

Operation, maintenance, and upgrading the Cisco
TelePresence Management Server
The Cisco TelePresence Management Server is a Cisco TelePresence-maintained ‘black-box’ server
designed to be operated using the LCD panel or a web interface. Operation and management of the
Cisco TMS software is performed solely through the Cisco TMS interface. Access to the server
operating system is available via local console connections or Microsoft Remote Desktop Client but is
not required for normal operations.
As with all servers, it is recommended that access to server hardware is restricted and housed in a
secure space. It is recommended the server remain on at all times for normal operation.
When delivered, the Cisco TelePresence Management Server operating system is ‘locked down’ and
hardened following Microsoft security recommendations this type of server. The server does not allow
remote connections, except where necessary for Cisco TMS communication with users and devices
managed by the Cisco TelePresence Management Server. The SQL database and other internal
components are not accessible remotely. Cisco TelePresence recommends that you do not modify
any of the operating system settings.
Cisco TelePresence Server Appliance Security Updates
To keep your software current and secure, Cisco TelePresence regularly publishes self-contained
security update installers.
Note: For the latest security updates, Cisco TelePresence recommends registering your product. You
will automatically be notified when ‘Cisco TelePresence Server Appliance Security Updates’ become
available.
Security updates are available on the Cisco TelePresence web site at:
 http://www.tandberg.com/support/TANDBERG_device_security.jsp
 http://ftp.tandberg.com/pub/software/content_server/security_updates
Note that the Microsoft Windows function Automatic Updates is off by default. This is by design to
avoid any untested changes to the underlying Operating System.
It is important that you download and install all security updates from Cisco TelePresence before using
this product, and maintain the integrity of all software by applying security and support updates when
they become available.

Cisco TelePresence Management Server software
installation/upgrades
The Cisco TelePresence Management Server is upgraded using the same Cisco TMS Application
software (and therefore the same steps) used in software-only installations of Cisco TMS. The Cisco
TMS installer automatically detects if the software is being run on a Cisco TelePresence Management
Server and acts accordingly.
To perform a Cisco TMS upgrade:
1. Using the Microsoft Remote Desktop Client, connect to the Cisco TelePresence Management
Server IP or hostname.
2. Login using the local administrator username and password.
3. Copy the Cisco TMS software installer s To the Cisco TelePresence Management Server using a
file share, web download, or the drive mapping feature of Remote Desktop Client.
4. Follow the process in the Installation and upgrade section, selecting the Complete installation.
Note: The SQL Server sa login information is needed during the upgrade. The SQL login defaults are
username: sa and password: TANDBERG.
Note: The Cisco TelePresence Management Server security policy is updated and maintained by the
Cisco TMS Installer. If an administrator makes changes to negate any of these security lockdown
steps, the security policy will be re-applied automatically when the Cisco TMS software installer next
runs
Getting started with Cisco TMS

Getting started with Cisco TMS
This section will help you configure Cisco TMS for first time use and become familiar with some of its
tools.
New installations verses upgrades
It is recommended you complete the topics in this section before considering the Cisco TMS
installation ‘complete’. During upgrades, these settings are automatically imported into your new Cisco
TMS installation. However, Cisco TelePresence recommends that you also review these topics when
upgrading to familiarize you with any new feature. A link to the Cisco TMS Release Notes can be
found in the References and related documents section.
Getting started topics
This section is broken into two major categories: configuration and orientation. The topics are
progressive: later steps rely on the previous steps already being completed. It is recommended a first
time administrator complete all the topics in order, then move on to further configuration and/or review
the Cisco TMS Administrator Guide for further details.

Cisco TelePresence Management Suite Installation and Getting Started Guide Page 38 of 70
Configuration topics
Cisco TMS user concepts
To log into the Cisco TMS web site, you must have a Windows username and password that the
server is configured to trust. By default, any local Windows user account will work, as well as any
Active Directory Domain user account if the server is a member of an Active Directory Domain.
Cisco TMS creates a user profile for each user that successfully logs into Cisco TMS, based on their
Windows username. Cisco TMS does not store user passwords – users use their existing Windows
password. If their Windows password is updated, they must use that updated password when logging
into Cisco TMS. While it is possible to create a user profile in Cisco TMS manually, this does not
create a Windows User account. Likewise, deleting a user profile in Cisco TMS does not alter their
Windows User account. A user must always have a valid Windows login to access Cisco TMS.
In each user profile in Cisco TMS there are personal information fields such as their Windows
username, their first and last name and their email address. These fields must be completed for each
user; otherwise, when the user browses to Cisco TMS, a pop-up window opens prompting them to
complete their user profile. Each user can choose the language to use within the Cisco TMS
Application from a drop-down list.
Note: While more languages are supported in the Cisco TMS Scheduler and notifications, only
English, French, Russian, Japanese, Chinese (Simplified) and Korean are supported in the main Cisco
TMS web interface. If another language is selected, pages that do not support this language selection
are displayed in English.
As of version 12.61, Cisco TMS is now available in English, French, German, Chinese, Japanese, and
Korean.
Figure 21 A user profile in Cisco TMS.
The remaining fields are not mandatory. If you are using Active Directory, you can configure Cisco
TMS to populate these fields automatically for new users; their profile will be created automatically the
first time the user logs into Cisco TMS.
Configuration topics
Cisco TelePresence Management Suite Installation and Getting Started Guide Page 39 of 70
Accessing Cisco TMS for the first time
Cisco TMS is accessed via a web browser - http://<serveraddress>/TMS where <serveraddress> is
the IP Address or hostname of your server.1
Figure 22 The IP Address or hostname of your server
If you are accessing the web site from the server console, you will be authenticated automatically with
your current username. If this fails, you will be prompted to enter your username and password.
Most browsers display two fields in the login window -- a username and password field. How you enter
your username depends on the type of Windows account that you are using:
Domain Users2 Enter username as: domain\username
Example: corp\joe.smith
Local Windows Accounts Enter username as: machinename\username
Example: TMS-2\administrator
The User Profile window is displayed after you authenticate. If not, look for any Pop-Up blocker alerts,
and disable pop-up blocking for the Cisco TMS web site.
Fill in the details of the user profile and click Update Your Personal Information.
Moving around Cisco TMS and the TMS GUI
Being the first user to log into Cisco TMS, you are automatically an administrator and have full access
to Cisco TMS. Functionality is grouped by the main categories across the top of the page.
Figure 23 Cisco TMS functionality categories.
Navigating around Cisco TMS is usually done with these top menu items. Hovering over a menu
expands it to show the options. Items with triangles next to their name have additional items under that
item. Click on an item to jump to that page. The Cisco TMS Sitemap under the Portal menu is a single
page with links to all the pages in Cisco TMS: the Sitemap is a quick way to find a page if you are
unsure of its location.
Using your mouse with the top menu items is just one example where the mouse hover is used.
Hovering over an item may display additional tips or information about the item in a tooltip. In other
pages, hovering displays the option for a drop-down menu. Clicking the orange icon opens a menu to
interact with that individual item.
Figure 24 Drop down available
1 Using the server hostname is recommended because, when used with Active Directory accounts and a
compatible setup, Integrated Authentication allows a user to log in without having to re-enter their Windows
username and password.
2 The username@’Domain DNS name’ format is also suitable, but less commonly used
Configuration topics
Cisco TelePresence Management Suite Installation and Getting Started Guide Page 40 of 70
Figure 25 Drop down activated
The order of items in most lists in Cisco TMS can be changed by clicking the column title. How a list is
currently sorted is indicated by a small triangle: in the image above, the list is being sorted by the
Name column in ascending order. Clicking on ‘Name’ would change the list to descending name order,
clicking on ‘Type’ would change the list to sort by device Type.
Some lists may have hundreds or even thousands of entries. Rather than show them all in a single list,
most lists in Cisco TMS are ‘paged’, and there are Previous and Next links at the bottom of the list.
Use these to page through long lists. Some lists also have search and filter options to control what
information is displayed to help you find what you are looking in large amounts of data. Many pages
also allow you to control how many rows are shown as a time: the more rows that are shown, the
longer it takes to load the web page.
Many pages in Cisco TMS have multiple views or subpages on the same page: shown as tabs across
the top of a window. There can be multiple levels of tabs as well.
The above image has multiple pages, including Summary, Settings, Call Status, Phone Book,
Connection, etc. Setting, the active tab, is displayed in a darker blue. The Settings tab has additional
views under it, including View Settings, Edit Settings, Extended Settings, and Compare Settings. View
Settings is the current view and is highlighted therefore.
Another important concept is collapsible panels. A panel has a Blue bar at the top. If the bar has arrow
icons at the right edge, clicking on the blue bar collapses or expands the panel. This allows you to
choose which areas of the screen to see more of.
Figure 26 Collapsible blue bar panel.
The top right corner of the Cisco TMS web page has a Search box and a question mark. The search
box provides a quick way to find an individual system. You can search by name, phone numbers,
serial numbers, and more. This is the quickest way to quickly display more information about a
system. The question mark is the help icon: clicking on it displays a new window with the online help
page for the open web page.
Permissions and groups in Cisco TMS
Administrators can control which Cisco TMS features users have access to, such as Booking and
Device Management, and which systems they can uses those features with. These feature and
system permissions combine for an effective ability per system. For example, it is possible to give the
IT team in Chicago the ability to fully control and manage endpoints in Chicago, but prevent them from
scheduling or making changes to systems in London.
Functions and systems that users do not have access to are normally hidden from them. If a user has
no Booking permissions, the Booking Menu is not shown. This allows you to create very simple
interfaces for users with a limited role so that they will not be overwhelmed with the full range of
features.
Cisco TMS controls permissions through User Groups. Groups are defined in Cisco TMS, and users
are assigned to groups. What permissions users have in Cisco TMS is based on which group(s) they
are a member of and the permissions that each group has. Permissions in TMS are cumulative –the
effective permission that a user has is a sum of all the group permissions they belong to.
Groups and permissions are controlled from the User Administration Menu under Administrative Tools.
To display or see a group permission go to Administrative Tools > User Administration > Groups >
Set permissions.
Cisco TMS has several default groups, but the most important groups are the User and Site
Administrator groups:
 All users are always a member of the User group, so it is not possible to edit the membership of
this group and any permission given to the User group is available to all Cisco TMS users.
Configuration topics
Cisco TelePresence Management Suite Installation and Getting Started Guide Page 41 of 70
 Anyone who is a member of the Site Administrator group has full access to all features and
systems in Cisco TMS. You can edit who is a member of the Site Administrator group, but you
cannot edit its permissions because it always has full permissions.
It is recommended administrators define more groups to allow greater control of permissions in Cisco
TMS. Which groups users are a member of can be set one of three ways:
 By editing the group itself. The Edit Group page displays all current members: click Add
Members, to specify which users to add to the group. A user can be a member of more than one
group. User groups can also be edited by editing the User, go to Administrative Tools > User
Administration > Users
 By assigning the user to a group automatically when the user profile is created. Cisco TMS does
this through ‘Default groups’. Groups set as a ‘Default group’ are automatically added to any new
user. At first installation, the Site Administrator group is marked as a Default group. This means
any person who logs into Cisco TMS, has a user profile created, and is automatically be added
the Site Administrator group giving them full rights to Cisco TMS. This is how you became an
administrator automatically when you first log into Cisco TMS. After you have logged in as the
administrator, it is recommended you stop the Site Administrator group from being a Default
group; otherwise every user will have full access permissions.
 By using Active Directory Groups. Cisco TMS has the option after configuration to allow Cisco
TMS to import existing groups from Active Directory. The Active Directory groups that a user
belongs to is automatically updated in Cisco TMS Groups when the user logs in. This simplifies
group administration because it reuses the existing Enterprise Directory for groups within Cisco
TMS l.
Permissions in Cisco TMS are a combination of feature permissions and system permissions. While
User Groups have permissions to control which portions of Cisco TMS a user has access to, System
Permissions are used to control what a user can do with a particular system. Later, when you are
adding/editing systems, you can alter the permissions for individual systems.
At this point, it is important to understand that there are default permissions given to a system when it
is first added to Cisco TMS. This is controlled by ‘Default System Permissions’ under
Administrative Tools > User Administration > Default System Permissions which allows you to
set the permissions that each group gets by default on newly added systems.
Configure a baseline permissions setup
For initial setup, it is not important to define all your eventual groups, but it is important understand
how permissions are set and to establish a baseline of what permissions you want until you settle on a
more complete and formal configuration.
As a best practice, the following initial configuration steps must be done so that new users will not
have Cisco TMS Administration rights, and you have a default group for new users with a baseline
permission set. The permissions can be changed at any time, but it is recommended administrators
start planning from the beginning on how access will be controlled and what features users will have
access to by default.
1. Create a new group to use for all your trusted users. Go to Administrative Tools > User
Administration > Groups and click New. Enter a name, such as ‘All company users’ and click
Save
2. Assign the default permissions that you want all Cisco TMS users to have to the new group. Click
on the Group Name in the Edit Group listing, and click Set Permissions. Select the check box for
each permission that you want group members to have. For a starting point that gives users full
access except to Cisco TMS configuration, select all the check boxes except those under
Administrative Tools. Use the check boxes in the blue title bars to select or clear all check boxes
in that section. Click Save
3. Change the Default Groups. Go to Administrative Tools > User Administration > Default
Groups. Clear all the check boxes except for the Users Group and your new Group. This means
any person who logs into Cisco TMS will automatically be added to your new group, and be given
the permissions that group has. Click Save
4. Change the Default System Permissions. Go to Administrative Tools > User Administration >
Default System Permissions. You will see that the new group has no permissions, and the User
Configuration topics
Cisco TelePresence Management Suite Installation and Getting Started Guide Page 42 of 70
Group has all permissions. Clear all the check boxes for the User Group, and assign the
permissions you want for the new user group. Click Save.
5. Ensure only intended users have Site Admin access. Go to Administrative Tools > User
Administration > Groups. Click on the Site Administrators group and click Edit. In the Members
list, ensure that only the users you want to have Administrator rights are listed. If any other
accounts are listed, select the check box in their row and click Remove. Click Save
These steps have established a baseline permissions model that:
 Prevents new users from being Site Administrators.
 Setup a ‘baseline’ permissions group.
 Ensures that all new users and systems will have the baseline permissions configured on them by
default.
Beyond initial configuration, administrators must plan their Cisco TMS deployment in terms of who
they wish to do what in Cisco TMS. This is controlled through Group Membership, Group Permissions,
and System Permissions.
Review and set important Cisco TMS defaults
Cisco TMS is highly customizable to meet your organization needs and can be configured at any time.
Most settings are configured automatically or have suitable default values. However, there are some
important settings to review and configure as part of your initial setup, to ensure that they meet your
needs and to simplify the configuration of other Cisco TMS features.
This topic outlines the settings to review and configure at first configuration. For complete details on
each setting, see the online help or the Cisco TMS Administrator Guide.
The majority of Cisco TMS configuration settings are controlled from the Administrative Tools menu.
Figure 27 General settings.
Significant Administrative Tools > General Settings for review are:
 System Contact/Email –When completed, these settings display a Contact link on the bottom of
all Cisco TMS pages so that users can easily contact you for help.
 Enable Auditing – This setting enables Audit logging that is, configures Cisco TMS to keep
detailed logs of all changes to systems, users, and other key elements. The Audit Log is
accessible in the Administrative Tools menu. This setting is disabled by default, but security
conscious administrators may want to enable it from the outset. But note that enabling this feature
causes the Cisco TMS database to grow significantly faster.
 Release Key/Option Keys – If you did not enter your release key and option key during
installation, you can enter them here. If you are upgrading from a trial version or adding new
options, this is where license information is entered.
See Installing licenses documentation for further information on licenses and release keys.
Significant Administrative Tools > Network Settings for review are:
Configuration topics
Cisco TelePresence Management Suite Installation and Getting Started Guide Page 43 of 70
 SNMP Community Name – This is a comma separated list of common SNMP strings that Cisco
TMS uses when discovering and adding systems. If you use a customized SNMP Community
Name on your existing systems, be sure to add it to this list.
 E-mail Addresses to Receive System… - Enter your email address here so that Cisco TMS can
send you notifications about rogue endpoints, system event failures, and for other administrative
messages. Multiple email addresses can be entered separated by commas.
 Automatic System Discovery – By default this setting is enabled, automatically adds the
systems that Cisco TMS discovers to a folder in System Navigator, and configures their
management properties to work with Cisco TMS. This makes Cisco TMS very simple to set up.
Cisco TMS configures the systems with basic settings from the ‘Discovered Systems Template’.
Later, if there are default settings you wish all new systems to have, update that template.
 Active Directory – These settings allow Cisco TMS to leverage Active Directory for its user and
group settings. If the Cisco TMS server is a member of a domain, Cisco TelePresence
recommends that you enable these settings by entering a valid Windows domain account. The
account does not need to be an administrator account, just a normal user account. If Lookup
User Information… is enabled, when a new user profile is created, Cisco TMS automatically
populates as many of the fields in the user profile as possible from Active Directory. Allow AD
Groups simplifies Cisco TMS Groups by allowing you to use groups from Active Directory as
Cisco TMS user groups which automates which Cisco TMS groups a user belongs to. See the
Cisco TMS Administrator Guide for further details on Active Directory Groups.
 Scan SNMP Capable Systems to Allow… - This setting allows Cisco TMS to detect when a
system goes offline more quickly. Cisco TelePresence recommends that you enable this setting.
 SNMP Broadcast/MultiCast Address(es) – The network addresses that were configured in the
Cisco TMS installer are displayed. Cisco TMS sends an SNMP query to these addresses to find
new systems. If your network spans multiple networks, add the broadcast address for each one,
separated by commas to allow Cisco TMS to find systems automatically. Do not worry if all the
networks are not represented here because systems can also be added manually and through
systems contacting Cisco TMS.
 Enforce Management Settings… - This setting is enabled by default and is recommended to
ensure that systems are properly configured to point to your Cisco TMS server.
 Advanced Network Settings
 To account for diverse network configurations, Cisco TMS supports the notion of two networks
that can access Cisco TMS. This is used to account for a remote network, such as one outside
the organization firewall or proxy that you may have systems on and want to manage3. These
settings are critical because Cisco TMS must know its own network addresses to properly
configure systems to communicate back to Cisco TMS.
 The ‘local’ or LAN network is normally synonymous with your organization’s internal network. The
‘public’ network is a second network that can access Cisco TMS and is generally used to
represent the public internet or a network outside the organization firewall. Each system added in
Cisco TMS has a Connectivity parameter that you use to tell Cisco TMS which network identity to
use when communicating with that system. The public network addresses are used always used
when using the SOHO/Behind Firewall support in Cisco TMS.
 TMS Server IPv4/IPv6 Addresses – These addresses were configured during installation and
are the IP addresses used to reach your Cisco TMS Server
 TMS Server Fully Qualified Host Name - Internal LAN – The fully qualified DNS hostname used
to access your Cisco TMS Server from the internal, or local, network. This setting will be used
with systems that support DNS and must be configured correctly. If the server has no hostname
that is usable, enter the IP address that systems would use to reach Cisco TMS.
3 TMS is still only connected to one physical LAN port and only one IP Address. TMS does not support
multihomed networking. The public hostname used will resolve to a IP forwarded to the IP address of the TMS
server.
Configuration topics
Cisco TelePresence Management Suite Installation and Getting Started Guide Page 44 of 70
Note: The Cisco TMS Agent application does not use the fully qualified DNS hostname configured
here, although they may/could be the same in a single Cisco TMS environment (recommended). The
Cisco TMS Agent uses the actual local hostname of the Cisco TMS server and this must match the
DNS A record for the Cisco TMS Agent. In a Cisco TMS redundant setup, the fully qualified DNS
hostname configured here must be unique and resolvable to reflect the Cisco TMS redundancy; that
is, resolvable to the network load balancer. However, DNS records for each particular redundant
Cisco TMS (local hostname) will also need to be created so that the Cisco TMS Agent can resolve
and thereby replicate between the TMSs appropriately.
 TMS Server Address (Fully Qualified Host Name or IPv4 Address) – Public or Behind the
Firewall respectively - This must be the fully qualified DNS hostname used to access your
Cisco TMS server from an outside network if that is different from the local hostname. This setting
must be configured to use features such as SOHO/Behind Firewall support. If the server has no
hostname that is usable, enter the IP address that systems would use to reach Cisco TMS.
 Automatic Software Update – This functionality allows Cisco TMS to automatically check for
new software available for your systems over a secure link, and to notify you of your Service
Contract status for your Cisco TelePresence Systems. No personal information is sent during this
communication except the system identification information such as serial numbers and hardware
identifiers. If you do not wish to have Cisco TMS check for software, you can disable this feature.
If your network requires a web proxy to reach the internet, configure its properties here.
 Secure-Only Device Communication – This setting is disabled by default and only be enabled
in specific instances. See the Implementing Secure Management documentation available on the
Cisco TMS installation media for more information.
Significant Administrative Tools > E-Mail Settings were configured during the Cisco TMS
installation. However, if your mail server requires SMTP Auth to be able to send email, configure an
appropriate username and password here. The settings are tested when you click Save to ensure that
they are valid.
Significant Administrative Tools > Conference Settings settings control most of the Cisco TMS
behavior for scheduled calls and for monitoring of active calls. Significant settings are:
 Default Bandwidth – The default bandwidth suggested for H.323 and SIP calls in Cisco TMS
Scheduling.
 Default ISDN Bandwidth – The default bandwidth suggested for ISDN calls in Cisco TMS
Scheduling
 Set Conferences as Secure by Default – Cisco TMS can work with systems that support
encryption and those that do not. This setting controls the default behavior for Scheduled
Conferences. ‘If Possible’ is the default setting and enables encryption when all systems in a call
support it.
WebEx integration
For WebEx booking to work, the booking user must have a WebEx User & Password defined in their
Cisco TMS profile. This is done so the correct user 'owns' the meeting in WebEx and can log in and
operate the WebEx call.
Early iterations of WebEx used a shared account, which while made booking available to everyone, it
was less functional because users did not have the correct permissions on the created WebEx
meetings.
Configuration topics
Cisco TelePresence Management Suite Installation and Getting Started Guide Page 45 of 70
Cisco TMS routing and zones
To automate conferencing and increase reliability, Cisco TMS actively manipulates dialing information
shown to users and systems by interpreting the status and configuration of systems it is managing and
understanding of the network. This reduces the technical details that users need to understand. All of
these decisions are handled automatically by Cisco TMS.
This information is defines as Zones, and Cisco TMS uses this configuration information to coordinate
and integrate with connected networks. There are IP Zones, and ISDN zones. The administrator
defines the zones that represent their network, and then systems in Cisco TMS are automatically
associated with the zone. During installation, two Zones are defined named ‘Default’.
These need to be expanded upon to implement a network that goes beyond a single location. Zones
are created and managed in Cisco TMS in Administrative Tools > Locations.
ISDN zones
ISDN zones define the ISDN network in a location. A location is an area that all has the same ISDN
dialing behavior: Therefore, a location could be as small as a building or as large as an entire city or
state, but all the systems assigned to a zone must share all the same ISDN dialing information:
· Country/Region - Defines which dialing rules to use. For example, do I dial 011 or 00 to dial
international calls?
· Area code – Allows Cisco TMS to make determinations about long distance dialing.
· Line prefixes – Defines any prefix digits – such as dialing 9 to get an outside line from a
PBX.
· Digits to dial for internal calls – How many digits to dial when making calls between
systems in the same ISDN zone. For example, if you are using a PBX, it may only be
necessary to dial the last 4 digits between two local systems.
· Area Code Rules – Used to further tweak the dialing behavior of Cisco TMS with regards to
local and long distance calling.
How many ISDN Zones you need to represent your network depends on how many different ISDN
dialing behaviors there are. If systems share the identical settings for the above properties, they can
share the same ISDN Zone.
All ISDN numbers in Cisco TMS are stored as ‘fully qualified numbers’; that is, the number is entered
and shown as the full number, including its country code information. For example: a US phone
number is shown as +1 703 7094281 and a Norwegian phone number is: +47 67125125. By storing
numbers in a fully qualified format instead of how one system dials a number, the same number can
be used by any system in the world because Cisco TMS (with ISDN Zones) knows how to manipulate
the number so that any of the systems it manages can dial it properly.
IP zones
The job of an IP zone is twofold – to create the idea of locality in an IP network, and to provide
information for connecting from the IP network using Gateways and URI dialing.
IP Zones are purely logical entities and do not necessarily map to any physical boundary. Cisco TMS
uses IP Zones to influence its routing decisions because it relates to distance to answer the question
‘Which system is closer to me?’ Two systems that are both in the same IP Zone would be considered
‘local’ to each other. Locality affects choices such as selecting an MCU – a local MCU may be
preferred. IP Zones also provide gateway and dialing information about the network a system is
attached to. If an organization does not have widespread IP connectivity between sites, and prefers to
use ISDN when making certain connections, that is also controllable through IP Zones.
For most organizations, IP Zones provide gateway information for the IP network. The number of IP
Zones needed is based on how many gateway paths there are to the network. For more diverse
networks with distributed MCUs, IP Zones can also be used to control which MCU is preferred for
different groups of endpoints.
Configuration topics
Cisco TelePresence Management Suite Installation and Getting Started Guide Page 46 of 70
Proper Zone configuration is essential in order for phone books and the scheduling to function
properly, therefore an understanding of Zones is essential and it is recommended basic zone
configuration be undertaken as part of the initial configuration.
Adding zones for initial configuration
To start a simple network plan:
1. For each system that Cisco TMS will manage initially that has ISDN directly connected to it
(including MCUs, Gateways and endpoints), create one ISDN Zone, if necessary. Go to
Administrative Tools > Locations > ISDN Zones and click New. Complete all applicable fields
and click Save.
Consider whether an existing zone has the same values. For instance, if you have an MCU,
Gateway, and endpoint all in the same building, that all use the same ISDN dialing behaviours,
they can all use the same ISDN Zone.
You can add additional zones subsequently; normally before or after adding a new system
2. For each IP Gateway (gateways that act as a pooled service can be considered as a single
gateway), create one IP Zone. Go to
Administrative Tools > Locations > IP Zones, click New and complete all the gateway
information that applies, including prefixes and DID numbers. Select the ISDN Zone that applies to
the Gateway this zone contains. Click Save
By default, when calling between two different IP Zones, ISDN is preferred, if available. Use the
lists at the bottom of the screen to set which zones you prefer to use IP when calling between.
If you have no Gateways, you still must have at least one IP Zone. A zone named ‘Default’ was
created during the installation of Cisco TMS and can be used as your sole IP Zone.
3. Select which Zones to use as the default for newly added systems added to Cisco TMS by
Automatic System Discovery. When adding a system manually, this value can be overridden. You
can also change a system zone by editing its settings. Go to Administrative Tools >
Configuration > General Settings. Select the Default ISDN and IP Zone settings and click Save.
For more assistance with Zones and advanced routing scenarios, see the Cisco TMS Administrator
Guide.

The system navigator
The System Navigator is the starting point for adding, managing, and organizing systems in Cisco
TMS. Go to System > Navigator. It is where systems are organized into a hierarchal structure of
folders, similar to your computer file system. This folder structure, known as the Navigator Tree, is
used throughout Cisco TMS when interacting with systems, including the view of systems that users
see when Scheduling calls.
In a new installation, two default folders are displayed in the list on the left side of the page: a root (top
level) folder called Company Name and a child folder, Discovered Systems. The page is organized
into two panels: a tree view on the left, and a details panel on the right which provides information
about the selected item on the left.
Figure 28 Company Name and Discovered Systems.
You can define any folder structure under the root folder, they are purely for organizational purposes
to make it easier to find systems and to set system permissions. The same folder structure is seen by
all users, and is used throughout Cisco TMS, therefore it is recommended you design a scheme that is
meaningful for your users. A common model is one based on geography and organization; for
example:
Figure 29 A common geographical organization model
In addition to viewing systems by folder, you can change the tree to display systems by Type, Status,
and Manufacturer for example by selecting from the drop-down menu at the top of the tree. However,
you can only add, move, or remove systems in the Folder View.
Set up default folders
1. Rename the default root folder: click on the Company Name folder. The right panel shows the
contents of that folder. Click Edit this Folder at the top right-hand side of the screen. Rename the
folder with an appropriate company name and click Save.
2. Add any additional folders. Folders are not required, but are recommended for organizational
reasons. You can always add/remove folders subsequently. To add a folder, click on the folder
that will be its parent folder in the tree. Then in the right panel, click Make New Folder. Enter a
name and description (optional), and click Save.
3. Repeat the previous step for as many folders as required.

Adding a system
To manage a system, it must first be added to Cisco TMS. As part of your installation, Automatic
System Discovery was enabled, and Cisco TMS may have already added some systems to the
Discovered Systems folder. Click on the Discovered Systems folder to display these systems in the
right panel.
To add a system, it must be online and you need to know its network address (IP Address or
Hostname) and any passwords or SNMP Community names. Some system types or systems that
have been locked down for security reasons may require some configuration before being added to
Cisco TMS. The examples below assume you are adding a Cisco TelePresence endpoint: see the
Cisco TMS Product Support document for full details for each type of system.
1. Navigate to the parent folder and click Add Systems in the right panel.
Figure 30 The Add Systems tab.
The Add Systems page is displayed with several tabs. The first tab allows you to enter a system
by entering its information directly. From List displays all the systems that are currently in the
Cisco TMS database either through discovery or by manual addition. Pre Register Systems is for
adding systems that may not be online yet. Add Room/Equipment adds specialized types of
systems used in Cisco TMS Scheduling.
2. In the Add systems page, enter the IP Address or Hostname of the system. Select in the Location
Settings. (Multiple systems can be added at once using a range4 or comma separated list of IP
Addresses.)
The Advanced Settings panel allows you to specify additional optional details. Click on the panel
menu bar to expand this section. These choices are not needed this example.
3. Click Next.
A progress window is displayed while Cisco TMS connects to the address and determines the type
of system being added, and the system configuration. As part of the process, Cisco TMS
configures the management settings so that the system can communicate with Cisco TMS.
4. If a password is needed, Cisco TMS prompts you for the system password. Enter the password
and click Next
After Cisco TMS has successfully contacted and interrogated the system, a Results page shows
the status for each system that it tried to add.
4 Do not enter large ranges of IP Addresses. Due to system discovery and timeouts required, scan time can be
several seconds per IP.

Update automatically discovered systems
Navigate to the Discovered Systems folder in the System Navigator. View the configuration of each
system and update any settings, taking special note of ISDN and IP Zones, as appropriate.
You may also need to update the Permissions for the system so that your new user groups have
permission to access the system. Go to the Permissions tab.
You can also move the systems to another folder by selecting the check box next to the system and
clicking Move/Copy when viewing the folder listing.
In the future, Cisco TMS will notify you by email notification whenever it discovers a new system using
the System Notification setting that you configured in a previous step. View the newly added system,
review and update its settings as necessary.
See the Cisco TMS Administrator Guide for more thorough explanations of all the management
options available in Cisco TMS.
Configuration templates
Configuration Templates allow you to define a group of configuration parameters as a set to be applied
together to systems. The template can even include configuration choices for different system types,
and Cisco TMS will only apply the settings that relate to the individual system being updated.
Administrators can define several templates, and can apply them to systems manually, automatically
when they are added to Cisco TMS, or even persistently each time the system is powered up.
Configuration Templates are managed from the Systems > Provisioning > Configuration
Templates menu.
As part of the default installation, there is a default ‘Discovered Systems Template’ containing a group
of settings that are automatically applied to all systems automatically added to Cisco TMS by System
Discovery. This was done via the Default Configuration template for Discovered Systems setting
under Administrative Tools > Configuration > Network Settings. This topic review this default
Template as a working example of how to use Configuration Templates.
Editing a template
1. Open Systems > Provisioning > Configuration templates.
2. Click on ‘Discovered Systems Template’ to open the View Settings page, with all settings and
values that make up this template. Note that each item has a setting name, system type, and
value. The ‘Type’ for the settings in this template is ‘Other type’ because they are Cisco TMS
configuration settings, not configuration options from the device commands itself.

6. Click Set on Systems. The job of applying the template to systems occurs in the background on
the Cisco TMS server. You can view the progress in the Provisioning Activity Status page under
Systems > Provisioning.
Phone books
One of the key features of Cisco TMS is the ability to offer centralized phone books for managed
systems. As part of the initial configuration, it is recommended you familiarize yourself with how Phone
books are assigned to systems.
There are four main concepts:
· Phone book – A listing of contacts. Contacts can include ISDN, IP, SIP, and Telephone
numbers for each entry. Multiple phone books can be created in Cisco TMS and each one
can be assigned to different users-groups and systems. Phone books are created/managed
from Phone books > Manage Phone books.
· Local vs. Server Phone Books – Local Phone Books are the directories stored and
available on most endpoints. These are normally set up and edited from the local endpoint.
Server Phone Books are the phone books are created and managed in Cisco TMS, not the
endpoint or system.
· Phone Book Sources – A phone book in Cisco TMS can be populated from one or more
phone book sources. Cisco TMS can create phone books from a variety of sources including
Active Directory, H.350 Servers, Gatekeepers and files. Phone book sources are
created/managed from Phone Books > Manage Phone Book Sources.
· Setting on System - This is the process that associates a system with a phone book so that
the system can read and display the phone book contents. Phone books can be set on any
number of systems, and each system can have multiple phone books associated with it. This
allows you to create multiple phone books for different purposes and assign them to the
specific systems that need them. Setting on Systems is done via the Phone book page at
Phonebooks > Manage Phonebooks. It is also possible to assign phone books to an
individual system in System Navigator using the Phone Book tab when viewing a system.
· Access Control – Utilize ‘TMS User Groups’ to define which user groups are to have read
access to each phone book. While, if the Cisco TMS Agent is enabled, utilize ‘Provisioning
Directory Groups’ to define which Provisioning Directory Groups shall have access to each
phone book.
The default ‘all systems’ phone book
As part of the initial installation, there are two default phone books that are created. The first is a
simple phone book that contains all the systems that are managed by Cisco TMS, and this phone
book is assigned to all the systems that Cisco TMS automatically discovered. The phone book starts
with a list of all the current Cisco TMS systems and this list is from a phone book source that was
created during installation.
The second default phone book created during initial installation is the Provisioning Phone Book. If the
Cisco TMS Agent is enabled, this phone book contains all the users that are found in the
Provisioning Directory. This phone book is created from the Provisioning Phone Book source. Note
that if FindMe is not being used, and only the Device URI is being used in the Provisioning Directory,
then the Provisioning Phone Book Source will not be populated until users begin to log into their
devices.
Scheduled conferencing
With your server in place, and systems added into Cisco TMS, you can now look to add new
functionality to your network via automated call launching and control. When scheduling conferences
with Cisco TMS users do not need to worry about network protocols, MCUs, or gateways: Cisco TMS
Orientation topics
Cisco TelePresence Management Suite Installation and Getting Started Guide Page 54 of 70
handles infrastructure choices and compatibility checking automatically. However advanced users can
tune the scheduler and tweak the conference selected methods, as needed.
Cisco TMS offers several interfaces to schedule conferences:
 SCHEDULER is an interface aimed at the mass audience, with administrator-defined limits on the
allowed settings.
 Free/Busy Overview is best when you just need to know which systems are available and
require a quick meeting.
 The ‘New Conference’ page in Cisco TMS is the most robust of all the scheduling interfaces and
offers all the possible control and settings.
For this example, we will use the New Conference page in Cisco TMS.
Creating your first scheduled call
1. Go to Booking > New Conference to open the New Conference page.
Figure 38 The New Conference page.
The page has three main areas:
· The top section, Basic Settings is primarily for setting the dates and time of the meeting.
· The Advanced Settings section in the middle is for setting additional parameters for the
conference such as encryption, recording, or bandwidths.
· The bottom section is the most important, where the meeting participants, and call routing
information is presented.
2. Enter a conference Title. This will be displayed in all Cisco TMS interfaces, and is included in the
emails sent about the conference.
3. Set the conference start time.
4. Set the duration or end time for the conference.
5. The Recurrence Settings button allows you to set a meeting to happen more than oncefor
example, a weekly or daily meeting.
In the Advanced Settings section, set the configuration options for this one conference. Most
settings will take their default values from the Conference Default values you configured under
Administrative Tools. We do not cover all the possible options in this example.
Orientation topics
Cisco TelePresence Management Suite Installation and Getting Started Guide Page 55 of 70
· Picture Mode controls the layout of the multiple participant conferences. The three choices
map to different layouts depending on the MCU being used: Voice Switched means full
screen layouts in which one participant is seen at a time; Continuous Presence means
multiple participants at a time with equal sized video windows; Enhanced CP means
Continuous Presence with unequal sized video windows. This setting can also be changed
“on the fly” while monitoring the conference.
· The bandwidth settings control the speeds at which the calls will be placed there are separate
settings for ISDN and IP speeds.
· Secure controls whether encryption is used during the conference. If you set it to ‘yes’, Cisco
TMS ensures that only endpoints that it knows can do encryption will be scheduled for the
conference.
The Conference Information tab is an optional area that allows you to add additional notes
about the conference that can be referenced later when reviewing scheduled calls.
6. Add participants to the conference in the Participant tab. Click Add Participant to open a new
window.
Figure 39 Available participants
7. Available participants are displayed and a planner view shows their availability, based on existing
scheduled and ad-hoc meetings. The colored vertical lines represent your current requested time
for the scheduled meeting.
8. The tabs running across the window show all the available types of participants you can select
from. If you’ve used Scheduling before, the default view is a ‘Last Used’ tab, giving you quick
access to the systems that you have used recently. The other tabs, ‘Endpoints and Rooms’,
MCUs’, ‘External’, and Phone Books, list all the available participants from that category.
When a category is selected using the tabs, the list of available participants updates showing their
availability. Hover over any system, or the blocks in the planner view, for additional details about
the system or scheduled meeting.
9. Add participants to the meeting by selecting their check box and clicking the > button to add them
to the list of selected participants on the right side of the window.
Orientation topics
Cisco TelePresence Management Suite Installation and Getting Started Guide Page 56 of 70
Note: You do not need to add any network infrastructure components like MCUs, or Gateways; Cisco
TMS will handle this for you automatically.
10. To add systems that are not managed systems in TMS, such as dialing to a system in another
organization, or adding telephone participants, use the External tab. From here, you can add
conference slots for dial in, or dial-out participants. For dial-out participants, enter their contact
information, and Cisco TMS will automatically connect them to the conference at the scheduled
time. For dial-in participants, Cisco TMS reserves the capacity needed to host the site in the
conference and provides you with precise dial-in information to forward to the participant. After all
the participants have been added, click OK.
11. You are returned to the conference page, with the participant section of the page showing your
selected participants. Additional tabs allow advanced scheduling tasks such as altering how calls
are connected, or setting specific MCU conference settings for the conference.
12. The Video Conference Master drop-down controls which system is designated the meeting
organizer. Cisco TMS will use this system to ask users whether the meeting should be extended
when it is about to expire, or that it uses to connect the sites if the conference is not scheduled to
be an Automatic Connection. Update the Conference Master, if necessary.
Note: Cisco TMS will only show participants in this list that are compatible with the onscreen
messaging features of TMS.
13. Click Save Conference. Cisco TMS performs the routing calculations to determine the best way
to connect your selected participants. This includes protocol selection, compatibility checking,
ensuring systems are available, manipulating ISDN numbers as needed, and including
infrastructure resources needed, such as including a MCU or recording device.
If Cisco TMS is unable to complete your booking request, due to lack of availability, lack of
network resources, or there is no known route to connect the participants together, you are
returned to the New Conference page and a message banner shows why it was not possible to
save the meeting. You can edit the conference settings to try to resolve the issue and save the
conference again.
14. If Cisco TMS completes your request, you see a Confirmation page showing the details of your
meeting, including the participant list and how each of those participants are scheduled to connect
to the conference, including the exact dial string any participants must dial. The Conference ID is
a unique identifier for a conference that allows administrators to quickly identify a specific instance
of a meeting.
Figure 40 An ICS attachment
You will also get an email confirmation sent to you with an ICS attachment which allows you to insert
the event directly into your Outlook (or compatible) calendar.
Viewing existing conferences
To find the details about an existing conference, you can use the List Conferences feature. From this
view, you can see all the settings that were configured for the conference, the route Cisco TMS built to
connect the call, and a log of events. If the conference is scheduled for a time in the future, you can
also edit the conference to change its settings.

1. Go to Booking > List Conferences.
2. The top portion of the screen allows you to filter the list based on specific criteria such as date,
conference owner, status, and even participants. To filter the list, set the parameters you wish and
click Search.
Note: By default when entering this page, you will only see conferences owned by you. If you wish to
see all conferences by all users, select All Users and click Search.

Monitoring and managing ongoing conferences
By monitoring the managed systems on the network, Cisco TMS provides graphical displays and
controls of both scheduled conferences (that is, conferences initiated by Cisco TMS) and ad-hoc
conferences (those started by users at their own systems).
The most advanced views and controls are available from the Monitoring menu which has three
interactive real-time applications.
Conference control center
The Conference Control Center (CCC) is a dashboard-like interface that allows you to monitor the
status of the conferences running on the network and control and interact with the systems in the
conference.
Figure 42 The Conference Control Center (CCC)
Graphical monitor
The Graphical Monitor is an interactive live ‘map’ of your conferencing network. Using animation and
colors, it shows a live view of the network including active calls, and systems that are unreachable.
The view is based on the folder structure set up in System Navigator.
Orientation topics
Cisco TelePresence Management Suite Installation and Getting Started Guide Page 60 of 70
Figure 43 Graphical Map Monitor
Graphical map monitor
The Graphical Map Monitor is a variant of the Graphical Monitor in which, instead of all systems
being shown on one page, each folder has its own page and administrators can overlay graphics
behind the icons and images; for example, to show geography or system location information.
Monitoring an ongoing scheduled call
Using the Conference Control Center, it is possible to get an overview of all ongoing conferences in
a single location. CCC has information about upcoming calls, and performs diagnostics on ongoing
conferences to alert you (using sound and colored icons) about their status. These diagnostics allow
conference operators to monitor large numbers of conferences across the entire network
simultaneously without having to manage each device separately.
From the CCC View, the list of conferences is provided on the right, color coded based on their current
status. Clicking on a conference in the Details panel on the right.
Figure 44 The Details panel shows the status, video snapshots, activity logs.
In the Details panel, you can view the status, video snapshots, activity logs from the call, and have full
access to interact with the call participants.
Orientation topics
Cisco TelePresence Management Suite Installation and Getting Started Guide Page 61 of 70
The top of the window shows the scheduled time and details of the call. Snapshots, if available, are
shown to the top right.
The Participants tab allows you to see details of each participant and interact with that call. Each row
shows the status, protocols in use, and the call connection details. These views update automatically
as you monitor the conference. Clicking on participant name displays icons across the bottom of the
list that allows you to disconnect, reconnect, mute, get details about the site, or even change the
conference layout the participant is seeing, for example. (Right-click on the participant name to display
the same options in a context menu.)
Figure 45 Participant Controls
The Event Log tab displays a history log of the conference, showing all connections, status changes,
and other details about the selected conference.
The Graphical View tab opens a mini version of the Graphical Call Monitor for just this single
conference. At the bottom of the Details window are buttons to interact with the conference as a
whole. You can add participants to the ongoing conference, change the conference settings, see any
additional information that was entered when the conference was booked, and end the conference.

Cisco TelePresence Management Suite Installation and Getting Started Guide Page 62 of 70
Reporting
Cisco TMS constantly collects data from the systems that it manages, as well as logging activity that
takes place in Cisco TMS itself. The Reporting section gives administrators the ability to visualize and
review historical data from their conferencing network.
Cisco TMS collects valuable data such as Call Detail Reports, Diagnostic Events and Alerts from
systems, details on how people are scheduling calls, comparisons of scheduled vs. actual usage, and
even a ROI Calculator based on actual conferencing usage.
Reports are available from the Reporting menu and are categorized to represent. Cisco TMS offers
numerous reports and they all use the same basic interface.
Figure 46 An example report from the Conferencing Statistics Report.
Each of the reports shares the following tools:
 Filtering - The top section provides filter and search criteria to allow you to control what data the
report encompasses, including date ranges, types, and systems or users to include. You can also
save a group of settings as a Template to reuse later by clicking Save as Template.
 Chart View – A graphical representation of the data. The chart type depends on the data being
displayed, including line, bar or pie charts.
 Data view - The actual data in the report, such as the call history, event log, or conference
history, shown in a table format. This information can be exported to Excel for further analysis by
clicking Export to Excel.
 Report View - Puts the Chart view into a presentation format that can be exported to a PDF file
by clicking Export to PDF.
